## Usage
`python main.py [--debug]`


### Task
Can you figure out how to use this API https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/ with this code sample (first answer) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17961318/read-frames-from-rtsp-stream-in-python to get an image from the camera.

#### Debug Mode
In order to test by code, I created a Developer API Account for EagleEye. However, I did not have any camera on the account. In order to test the code, I used [Mocktoon](https://mockoon.com/) to create a fake api that responded with the samples from the API docs. To use the fake endpoints, use the --debug flag.
